# Alice Wonderland Adventure

Welcome to the "Alice Wonderland Adventure" project! This creative endeavor was developed using Alice, an interactive storytelling and programming platform. The project is an imaginative adaptation of the beloved "Alice in Wonderland" story, where you can join Alice and her bunny on a whimsical journey into a fantastical forest filled with adventures.

**Project Details:**

- **Scene and Setting:** The project is set in a fantasy forest, creating a world where imagination reigns supreme. Alice and her bunny explore this magical realm, and the scene chosen for this project combines elements of fantasy and adventure.

- **Characters:** The program features a cast of characters, including two versions of Alice, two bunnies, and an ogre. These characters play vital roles in the interactive narrative and user choices.

- **User Interaction:** Users can engage with the story by making choices, such as selecting different paths for Alice and her bunny to follow. This interactive element allows users to shape the adventure's outcome.

**Expected User Experience:**

The project offers an immersive storytelling experience, where users can engage with the whimsical world of Alice's adventures. By making choices that affect the story's progression, users can explore different outcomes and paths. The goal is to capture the user's curiosity and invite them to run the program multiple times to discover all possible scenarios.

**Elements Implemented:**

- **Loops:** Two types of loops are incorporated: counter control loops for animating characters' movements and sentinel loops for controlling specific actions and events, such as when Alice runs from the ogre.

- **Arithmetic Expressions:** Arithmetic expressions are used to manage distances and create space between characters in the program, ensuring they don't collide.

- **Variables:** The program defines six variables to handle various aspects of the story, including events, character interactions, and distance calculations.

- **Scene Activation Event:** The scene activation event is utilized to transition between different scenes and settings in the program, allowing the story's environment to change.

**Challenges and Rewards:**

Developing this project required creativity, collaboration, patience, and logic. Challenges included animating characters' movements, arranging bipeds for smooth character actions, and handling program crashes. The project has expanded knowledge of the Alice platform and storytelling capabilities.

The completion of this project brings the reward of enhanced creativity, storytelling, and programming skills. It's an opportunity to explore a unique adaptation of a classic tale in an interactive and imaginative way.

Enjoy the "Alice Wonderland Adventure," and please feel free to explore and experience the various paths and outcomes within this whimsical journey.
